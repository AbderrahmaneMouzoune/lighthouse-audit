## Overview

Perform Lighthouse audits on websites using this simple Node.js project.

This project utilizes [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to perform audits on websites and generate insightful reports. The audit results include metrics related to performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO, and Progressive Web App (PWA) standards.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository :**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbderrahmaneMouzoune/lighthouse-audit
cd lighthouse-audit
```

2. **Install dependencies :**

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

To choose all the website and url to audit you need to change the `siteToAudit` constant on src/config.ts, respect the architecture to have no problem

```typescript
type WebSite = {
  name: string
  url: string
  pages: Page[]
}

type Page = {
  url: string
  name: string
}
```

### Usage

#### Run the audit

Execute the following command to run the Lighthouse audit :

```bash
npm run start
```

This command will generate an Excel file with the audit results in the `build` folder
-> To change the build folder you need to change `export const folderForGeneratedResults = 'audit_results'` on `src/config.ts` by the folder you want
-> To change the excel file name you need to change `export const filenameToGenerate = join(folderForGeneratedResults,'lighthouse_results.xlsx')` on `src/config.ts` by the file name you want
